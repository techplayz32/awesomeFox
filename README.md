# awesomeFox
awesomeFox - a project that wants to help you and improve your Firefox browser!

## Quick Explanation
### Why did I create this project?
I wanted to share my experience with Firefox and its forks. For a long time, I was switching between browsers because some of them were using too much RAM or were heavy on my CPU. Additionally, some were slow due to poor optimization or other issues. Through this project, I hope to help people choose the right browser for their needs. Perhaps I will even create a comprehensive guide on browsers in the future, who knows?

### What do these emojis mean?
‚úÖ = Documentation about that browser is completed  
üî® = Working on the documentation  
‚ùå = Documentation is not being started or completed  
‚ö†Ô∏è = Documentation needs to be updated
