# Installation
Go to the [Alex313031's Mercury repository](https://github.com/Alex313031/Mercury)[^1] and download the browser's version that is compatible with your CPU's supported instruction set (SSE3, SSE4/4.1, AVX, AVX2, and ARM). If you don't know your CPU's supported instruction set, you can check by download [HWiNFO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hwinfo/files/Windows_Portable/hwi_814.zip/download)[^2] on Windows or use command `lscpu | grep "avx, avx2, ssse3, sse4_1 or sse4_2"` on Linux.
